Welcome to CLI & Version Control Adventure! üöÄ

üëã Hey there, Future Coders!
Today, we're diving into the Command Line Interface (CLI) and Version Control systems like Git & GitHub! You‚Äôll learn to control your files like a pro ninja ü•∑ and collaborate like a tech wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

What is the CLI? üñ•Ô∏è

üí° The Command Line Interface (CLI) is like chatting directly with your computer in its own language!
While you can point and click with a mouse, using CLI lets you type commands to get things done super fast! üéØ

Windows Terminal Commands ü™ü

Let's start by creating, renaming, copying, cutting, and moving files in the Windows terminal.

Creating a Word Document:

In Windows, you can create a file using the echo command:


echo "This is a Word document" > my_document.docx

This creates a file named my_document.docx!

Renaming a File:

Use the ren command to rename files:


ren my_document.docx new_document.docx
Copying a File:

To copy files, use the copy command:


copy new_document.docx backup_document.docx
Cutting (Moving) a File:

To move a file (cut it from one place and paste it elsewhere):


move new_document.docx C:\Documents\Moved_Document.docx
Linux Terminal Commands üêß

Now let‚Äôs talk Linux!
Here‚Äôs how to create, rename, copy, cut, and move files in Linux.

Creating a Word Document:

You can use the touch command to create an empty Word document:


touch my_document.docx
Renaming a File:

To rename a file in Linux, use the mv command:


mv my_document.docx new_document.docx
Copying a File:

To copy a file, use the cp command:


cp new_document.docx backup_document.docx
Cutting (Moving) a File:

For cutting (moving) files, use the same mv command:


mv new_document.docx ~/Documents/Moved_Document.docx
Mac Terminal Commands üçè

On Mac, the commands are quite similar to Linux, but let‚Äôs review them with a fun twist!

Creating a Word Document:

Use touch to create a new file:


touch my_document.docx
Renaming a File:

To rename a file, again use the mv command:


mv my_document.docx new_document.docx
Copying a File:

To copy a file on Mac:


cp new_document.docx backup_document.docx
Cutting (Moving) a File:

And finally, to move a file:


mv new_document.docx ~/Documents/Moved_Document.docx
What is Git? ü§î

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your files (especially code!) over time.
Think of Git as a time machine ‚è≥ for your project‚Äîif you make a mistake, you can go back and fix it!

What is GitHub? üåê

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where developers can store and manage their Git repositories.
It‚Äôs like social media for code‚Äîyou can collaborate, review, and share your projects with the world! üåç

How Git and GitHub are Related? üîó
Git runs locally on your machine, managing your project versions.
GitHub stores these versions online so you can share your project, collaborate, or back it up safely.
Together, they make sure you never lose track of your awesome work! ‚ú®
Git Commands ‚Äì Let‚Äôs Get Our Hands Dirty! üßë‚Äçüíª

Here are some basic Git commands you‚Äôll use every day:

1. Git Configuration:

Set up your Git with your name and email (so Git knows who‚Äôs making changes):


git config --global user.name "Your Name" git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
2. Initializing Git in a Project:

To start tracking files in a folder:


git init
3. Encrypting Git (SSH Key Setup):

For secure access to GitHub, set up SSH:


ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you@example.com"
4. Adding Files to Git:

Tell Git which files to track:


git add .
5. Committing Changes:

Save a snapshot of the current version of your files:


git commit -m "Add awesome new feature"
6. Cloning a Repository:

To download a project from GitHub:


git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
7. Creating a Branch:

Want to try something new without messing up your main project? Create a branch!


git branch new_feature
8. Switching Between Branches:

Move to a different branch:


git checkout new_feature
9. Merging Branches:

Once your changes are perfect, merge them back into the main project:


git merge new_feature
10. Forking a Repository:

To make a copy of someone else's project in your own GitHub account (useful for collaboration):

Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork.
Click the Fork button (on GitHub).
11. Pushing to GitHub:

Send your committed changes to GitHub:


git push origin main
That‚Äôs a Wrap! üéâ

You‚Äôve just learned to navigate the CLI like a pro on Windows, Linux, and Mac, and have been introduced to Git and GitHub! Now, go ahead and practice these commands in your own projects! üöÄ
