# Definition of MVP

**MVP** stands for **Minimum Viable Product**. It‚Äôs the simplest version of your product that still provides value to users.

## Why is it a Game-Changer?

- Instead of building a complex product all at once, an MVP allows you to focus on core features, helping you avoid wasted resources.
- Getting your product out there quickly lets you start learning from real users sooner.
- By releasing an MVP, you can gather insights directly from users. Their feedback will help you understand what to improve or change.

### Saves Time & Money:
- **Quick Launch**
- **Real User Feedback**

## Examples of Successful MVPs

### Using Agile Methods

Agile is all about being flexible and quick in your development process. This allows you to adapt based on user feedback.

### Steps to Create Your MVP

1. **Identify Your Core Idea**  
    Define the main problem your product solves. For example, if you‚Äôre creating a meal delivery service, the core idea might be ‚Äúhealthy meals for busy professionals.‚Äù

2. **List Must-Have Features**  
    Focus on the essential features your product needs to solve that problem. For the meal delivery service, features might include:  
    - Online ordering  
    - Menu options  
    - Payment processing  

3. **Choose No-Code Tools**  
    Use no-code tools to help you build your MVP without programming skills. Some popular options are:  
    - **Bubble**: Great for web apps.  
    - **Webflow**: Perfect for creating responsive websites.  
    - **Glide**: Useful for turning spreadsheets into mobile apps.
