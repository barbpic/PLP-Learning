# What is a Pitch Deck?

A pitch deck is a concise presentation that tells the story of your company, highlighting the problem it solves, why it matters, and most importantly, why an investor should support your venture. According to TechCrunch, investors spend less than 5 minutes reviewing a pitch deck. Therefore, it's crucial to curate a presentation that delivers a powerful message in 5 minutes or less.
